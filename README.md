# saleae-logic-2-parser
This script parses Saleae Logic 2 output files (.csv) to process data packets byte by byte. Users can configure a threshold time, which is the time difference between two consecutive start times (start_time1 and start_time2), to efficiently identify and analyze data packets in the captured signal.
